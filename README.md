# Embedded ALA comments

The embed code consists of markup representing the comment (as a fallback) and a `script` tag that calls a live comment from our server. At the moment the markup is identical to the code that makes up a comment on the site; we might want to simplify it.

## Examples

* <a href="http://alistapart.github.com/comment-embed/demo/">Basic demo</a>
* Live example of <a href="http://eeinsider.com/blog/embeddable-comments-for-expressionengine/">an ALA comment on a 3rd party site</a>

## Sample Endpoints

We’ve added an example of how an endpoint for the script might work with Expression Engine, in <a href="https://github.com/alistapart/comment-embed/tree/master/templates">templates</a>. This is the one we have running on <a href="http://alistapart.com">alistapart.com</a> now.
