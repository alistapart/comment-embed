		<h2>Embedded ALA Comments</h2>
		
		<p>Thanks to Mat Marquis, we'll soon be able to offer the ability to embed A List Apart comments anywhere.</p>
		
		<p>The embed code consists of semantic code representing the comment (as a fallback) and a script tag that calls a live comment from our server. At the moment the semantic code is identical to the code that makes up a comment on the site; we might want to simplify it.</p>
	
		<p>Here's a sample:</p>
		
		<div class="ala-embedded-comment" id="ala-embedded-comment-1">
			<a href="#" class="commenter-avatar" target="_parent"><img src="http://d.alistapart.com/_made/pix/authors/uploads/photo_116023_60_60_c1.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a>
			<a class="commenter-name" href="#" target="_parent">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>
			<a class="comment-meta" href="http://alistapart.com/comments/a-list-apart-relaunches-new-features-new-design#333649" target="_parent">5:03 pm on January 25, 2013</a>

			<blockquote>I second the request for an article-only RSS feed.</blockquote>
			<p>On our <a href="http://alistapart.com/about/rss" target="_parent"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> page, you can now choose between a firehose feed (all <span class="caps">ALA</span> content) and a feed containing only articles and columns. Enjoy! :)</p>

			<blockquote>a point-by-point rundown of why the choices youâ€™ve made were made, would be right on point and very helpful to your readers</blockquote>
			<p>I agree, and we plan to address select decisions in a series of brief blog posts, such as this one <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-alt-text">on alt text</a>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<script src="../dist/comment-embed.min.js" async data-comment="1"></script>
		
		<p>The model is obviously embedded tweets, but these differ a bit in that they can have a lot more content.</p>
